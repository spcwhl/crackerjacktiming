For the last few months we've been hard at work on our upcoming game [Crypt Run][1], a realtime multiplayer dungeon crawler. Today I thought I'd take a quick break from development to give you a few details about the game.

In **Crypt Run**, you're an adventurer exploring procedurally generated crypts for gold and riches. The goal of the game is to get as much treasure as possible before the crypt collapses. Dangers lurk everywhere in the form of ghosts, goblins, spikes, slimes, giant spiders, skeletons, and of course, other players!

Skill and weapon upgrades also exit in the game, such as axes, daggers, bombs, speed potions, rings of regeneration, and more. As you can see from the above screenshot, we'll also have in-game achievements for you completionists out there.

**Crypt Run** is not an MMO; it's a session-based game, meaning players will be put into dungeons with around 2-10 other players. Games will last somewhere between 5-15 minutes each (these numbers all TBD).

## Sign up to alpha test

If you'd like to get early access to **Crypt Run** to help us alpha test the game, please [sign up for our newsletter][2] and we'll send you information about how to play in the next few weeks. We'll also be updating [Lava Blade][3] soon (nope, we haven't forgotten about it!), so you'll be getting info on how to play that as well.

Thanks for reading. Can't wait to play **Crypt Run** with you!
